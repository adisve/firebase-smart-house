# Firebase Smart House - Android Application

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to connect a Firebase real-time database with an Android application, simulating a smart house environment. 
The application is built using Android best practices and Jetpack Compose for the user interface. We also make use of the Firebase database API and the OpenAI GPT API for
a more robust speech-to-text implementation.

The application lets the user control three settings for their house: a light, a door, and a window. The user also has the option of using speech recognition in order
to voice their commands instead of toggling any of the three switches that control the smart house. More obscure commands are obfuscated with the help of GPT so that
the app can more easily map user input to a specific command
